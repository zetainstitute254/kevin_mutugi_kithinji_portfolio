# KEVIN MUTUGI KITHINJI'S PORTFOLIO

A personal portfolio website built with React to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. This site is designed to be clean, responsive, and easily customizable.

-----

## ✨ Features

  * **Modular & Component-Based**: The website is built with reusable React components for a clean and scalable codebase.
  * **Customizable Content**: All personal information is stored in a single data file (`cvData.js`), making it easy to update without touching the code.
  * **Professional Styling**: A clean and modern design is achieved using **CSS Modules** and **CSS Custom Properties** (variables) for a centralized and easy-to-change theme.
  * **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
  * **Smooth Scroll Navigation**: A smooth scroll effect is used for a better user experience when navigating between sections.

-----

## 💻 Technologies Used

  * **React**: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.
  * **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool for a quick development setup.
  * **CSS Modules**: For scoped and maintainable component-level styling.
  * **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamic behavior and data handling.
  * **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the foundational structure and styling.
